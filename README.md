## My process

I wrote the raw codes with html and completed my style file with the css flexbox structure.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I had a chance to consolidate my css knowledge. I used Flexbox in the project I was working as mobile first. When I switched to the desktop version, it was enough to change the flexbox alignment properties again.
